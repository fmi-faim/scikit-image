## Support for scikit-image

Welcome to scikit-image! We use GitHub for tracking bugs and feature requests.
GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/discussions)
should be used for reporting bugs or performance regressions. We prefer use of
GitHub [Discussions](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/discussions)
rather than issues for feature requests. This GitHub repository isn't the right
place to get support for using scikit-image, but the following resources are
available for that purpose.

### Support

[image.sc forum](https://forum.image.sc/tag/scikit-image): This is the
recommended place to post questions on how to perform a particular image
analysis task. The image.sc forum involves a larger image analysis community
across multiple software packages and thus has a better chance of finding
someone who has worked on a similar problem.

### Real-time Chat

For chat, we have the [skimage zulip](https://napari.zulipchat.com). Feel free
to ask questions there or just say hello and let us know how you are using
scikit-image!

### Developer Discussion

Discussions related to scikit-image development can also be raised with the scikit-image tag on the [Scientific Python discourse site](https://discuss.scientific-python.org/c/contributor/skimage).
